I am Susan Joshi, and welcome to my personal page. I have been working mostly on different technologies like Ruby, Golang and Javascript. I consider myself average developer, constanly learning stuffs through different projects and blogposts.

This is my personal static site where the contents are just my personal view and thoughts.
