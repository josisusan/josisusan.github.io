Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Susan Joshi from Nepal, currently living in the UK since Nov 2022. I am a dedicated father and husband, balancing family life with my professional journey in the tech world. My career began in 2012 after I earned a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Computer Science from Pulchowk, Kathmandu, Nepal. Since then, I've been passionate about exploring and mastering various programming languages.

I have a particular affinity for Ruby, Golang, and JavaScript. I enjoy delving into problems, understanding them thoroughly, and finding ways to automate solutions where it makes sense. Problem-solving through code is something I find deeply rewarding, and it drives much of my work.

Beyond coding, I love sharing knowledge and giving back to the tech community. As a member of Ruby Nepal, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to help organize [meetups](https://rubynepal.org/meetup/) and workshops, especially in colleges, to spread awareness and enthusiasm for Ruby. Engaging with this vibrant community has been an incredibly fulfilling experience, and Iâ€™m always eager to connect with others who share my passion for programming.

This blog is my personal space where I document my experiences, techniques, and learnings. It serves as a way for me to reflect on my journey, share useful insights with others, and look back on my achievements in the future. Through this platform, I hope to continue growing both personally and professionally while contributing to the broader tech community.
