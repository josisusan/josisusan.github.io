This is my personal website where I log my thoughts and learning into a central place.

The template inspiration was from a Jekyll theme [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). I have updated the theme with Grid and Flexbox and added my own customization.

## Create a new post
Custom command to create a new post, TITLE: Words separated with space
