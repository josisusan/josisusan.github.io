Debugging can often be tedious when relying on print statements and rerunning the program repeatedly. However, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides a powerful feature to streamline debugging, especially for CLI-based applications. By integrating terminal input with the VS Code debugger, you can interact with your application seamlessly during a debugging session.

To enable this functionality, you need to configure your `launch.json` file. Add the following line to your debug configuration:
```json
  "console": "integratedTerminal"
```

![VSCode Debugger Configuration for integrated terminal]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/easily-debug-cli-app-using-vscode-debugger-1.webp){:.post-image}

With this configuration, VS Code listens to input provided through the CLI. Now, you can set breakpoints and interact with the CLI directly in the terminalâ€”no more scattering print statements throughout your code.

This simple setup can greatly enhance your debugging efficiency and keep your workflow smooth.
